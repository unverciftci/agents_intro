# Introductory AI Agents Tutorial

AI agents (also called LLM agents) are autonomous software that interact with the real world. They are already adoted to the industry. There are great resources and development frameworks out there but a local and simple agent is maybe the best start. 

Here you can find notebooks which can run locally or on Google Colab so that you have full control of your agent:

- Notebook 1. We make out tiny LLM model up and running.
- Notebook 2. This is our first agent which can use tools.
- Notebook 3. For multi-turn tasks we provide memory to our agent.
- Notebook 4. Our agent can now take actions to do the task.

After following this basic tutorial you can build complex agents.

Good luck!
