# Introductory AI Agents Tutorial

AI agents (often called LLM agents) are autonomous software systems that can interact with the real world. They are already widely adopted in industry. While there are many powerful frameworks and resources available, starting with a simple local agent is often the best way to learn the basics.

In this tutorial, you’ll find notebooks that can run either locally or on Google Colab, giving you full control over your agent:

[Notebook 1.](https://github.com/unverciftci/agents_intro/blob/main/Notebook_1.ipynb) Getting a tiny LLM model up and running.

[Notebook 2.](https://github.com/unverciftci/agents_intro/blob/main/Notebook_2.ipynb) Building your first agent that can use tools.

[Notebook 3.](https://github.com/unverciftci/agents_intro/blob/main/Notebook_3.ipynb) Adding memory to support multi-turn tasks.

[Notebook 4.](https://github.com/unverciftci/agents_intro/blob/main/Notebook_4.ipynb) Enabling your agent to take actions to complete tasks.

After completing this tutorial, you’ll be ready to start building more complex agents.

Good luck!
